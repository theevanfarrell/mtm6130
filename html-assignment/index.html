            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Thank you for visiting my first website! I'm Evan Farrell, a first-year IMD student. I am interested in strategy, intellectual games, music, and all forms of creativity. In my previous coding projects, I used Python, so switching to Visual Studio Code is quite interesting. The project that made me fall in love with coding was a 10000-line text-based <abbr title="Role-Playing Game">RPG</abbr> I wrote in Python. Coding, as such, taught me the importance and joy of problem-solving.</p>

            <p>It was also while designing and developing games that I developed my love of coding and my ability to solve problems. I have made ports for different games, such as Garry's Mod for mobile and P.T. Silent Hill for PC. I worked on these two projects with another person. We completed both projects in our 52<sup>nd</sup> week of development, a full year early, because of our excellent communication and teamwork. The two games we made have over a <em>million</em> downloads each and show how perseverance pays off. I believe that one of the most meaningful things in this world is problem-solving. The quote below is one that I keep in my mind all the time which helps fuel me to be more driven and ambitious.</p>
